<p>As I finish up my time at Flatiron School I find myself reflecting on everything that I've learned.  When I started school about 6 months ago I didn't know anything about programming at all.  As I was working on my final project, a React web app with a Rails API backend, I was thinking about everything I was doing to overcome each problem.  I was able to debug issues using Rails console, the Chrome console, and Rails and React error messages.  I was able to google solutions to problems I knew would be easy enough to look up.  I had problems I had to overcome, and being able to execute on my vision allowed me to create something that was fairly intuitive.</p>

<p>I feel like I've learned as much about myself as I have about programming in these past few months.  I've learned what aspects of myself lend themselves to being good at this work.  With each project I learned as much as I could.  I tried to always find ways to challenge myself each time so that I was learning as much as possible and I feel like I have a pretty sound grasp on programming so far.  I chose projects designed to challenge myself in ways that I felt I needed improvement.  I felt this was the best way to make use of my learning.  I think I needed to design some better projects for my portfolio but ultimately I feel like I've learned a lot and can handle a wide variety of problems.  On the last project alone I had the ability to adapt new solutions I was unfamiliar with by understanding the context of my problem and finding similar solutions online.  Because I understood React and the Redux flow I was able to integrate new(to me) ideas and solutions into my app and keep everything in tact, or adapt it to my needs.  I don't believe this would have been as easy to accomplish if my understanding with React wasn't as complete.  These things seem to find a way of clicking when you least expect it but it's always this big picture understanding that I strive for, and once I reach it then smaller problems are easy to overcome quickly without serious issue.</p>

<p>I feel like the Immersive 4-month course was perfect for me.  I was able to force myself to adapt new knowledge everyday and challenge myself to use and re-use that knowledge.  The tenets of Flatiron have become more and more true all the time.  I came into the Immersive Program knowing it would require trust and faith while just doing as much as I can.  When you reach certain hurdles, all of it gets easier, so you have to choose for yourself what's worth spending time on.  It's not so easy to figure out but you will have a much better time the more you "discern" for yourself what you need to spend time on versus what you think you mostly understand and can skip or come back to later.  It can be easy to beat something simple into your head over and over because you don't think you "get it" yet.  However, it worked for me better to just let myself half-understand something and keep going.  Eventually I gain a bigger picture understanding, where I "get it" and it becomes easier to pick up the stuff I skipped.  It really is an "immersive" style.  The more you trust and just do it without worrying if you are getting it or not, the better you will do.  It can be easy to doubt yourself but if you just do the work, and do a little extra work when you are lacking in understanding, you will come out of this program knowing essentially everything you need to know.</p>

<p>Being a programmer is a powerful skill to have in this day and age.  I always felt I understood how technology works and now I understand more about how it is built.  I understand what limitations engineers have and how it affects the way products are designed.  Best of all I have an understanding that lets me see how problems are normally solved and see if I can add my own value to industry with my own ideas and solutions.  It really feels like I'm putting my potential to use.  I look forward to my days in my new career as a programmer and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>
