<p>Flatiron has a few rules for success that mostly revolve around confidence and persistence.   On more than one occasion I was able to keep my calm during coding challenges, projects, and other situations in able to overcome obstacles.  Early on I knew I would have trouble staying focused enough in order to get through the many labs and projects we had scheduled each day of the Bootcamp.</p>

<p>While I'm sure most people have similar solutions, my most reliable method for staying "in the zone" is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A">ChilledCow's lofi hip hop radio - beats to study/relax to</a>.  This specific radio station has helped me crank through many a problem.  Specifically the Youtube stream for whatever reason keeps me better in the zone than even their Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>I've relied on this youtube music stream to keep me in the perfect headspace to stay focused, keep my brain moving, and make new connections.  It keeps me mellow and calm but also distracted enough not to want to go and put something else on in the background.  Every in-person coding challenge this music kept me on-pace to finish on time.</p>

<p>I highly recommend coming up with your own rituals and methods to keep you "in the zone."  I find sometimes my brain can wander or seek distractions when I'm getting as sucked in to my work as I'd like.  This specific mix keeps my brain in a good mood, drops nice quotes from Bojack Horseman to Cowboy Bebop.  It has saved me more times than I can count and I would not have survived Flatiron without it.</p>
