<p>I've been working hard on my final project the past couple weeks.  It has been a big journey for me as I failed to complete my project the last time around.  I completed all my labs back then for the React-Redux module, the final curriculum in the Flatiron Immersive Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Since I had time to wait for the next cohort, I hadn't thought much about React for some time.  My project isn't particularly ambitious but as I'm completely new to coding in general, my goal with every project has been to challenge myself to learn in areas that I feel weak in.  I've very much enjoyed the way React works and the massive abilities the libraries give you.  There have been different learning curves with each language we've taken on, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and now React.  I have learnt a lot about myself and how well-suited I am to programming even though I haven't tried to build anything special or elegant quite yet.</p>

<p>Ruby has still been the hardest time I've had, going from zero knowledge to learning programming and having it stick.  With my Rails project I did my best to learn how to integrate with a public API.  With my JavaScript group project I chose to build the front-end so I could absorb as much as possible with DOM manipulation and JavaScript in general.</p>

<p>Now with React, I just wanted to choose a project I felt I could complete.  As an artist and game designer I've participated in a few Game Jams and I've always been more interested in creating an interesting scoped-down idea that feels complete than try to make something that is a half-baked preview of some future concept or a bigger project.  As such I (ironically enough) came up with a simple Game Jam organizational tool.  It just allows you to register teams and participants and assign them.  I had to use a JoinClass because I figured some people like sound designers or writers may want to participate on multiple teams.  It's an overly simple app but it put me to work to test just how much I had learned of React months before.</p>

<p>I encountered many issues I had never dealt with and I truly felt like everything Flatiron had taught me was being applied.  Not only in building an app that used both a Rails server back-end and a React.Js front-end, but in being able to identify the source of each problem and error, and push my way through them.  It has been a wild journey for me but it has only made me more confident that I am ready for what's next as I start looking for my first programming job.  I tried not to rely on solutions where I wouldn't learn much and I was able to deal with a lot of problems I didn't think I'd be able to when I started.  It's been enlightening to see the balance between organizing my thoughts enough to create a plan of attack, and then adjusting on the fly when my ideas for implementation were just not doable.  I had certain things I wanted my app to be able to do and was able to learn how to connect all my various components and import the right functions and React libraries in the right places to allow for an intuitive experience.</p>

<p>And I did it!  I developed a Full-Stack!  It talks to a backend server that I built, with an SQL database to keep track of my data.  I used Reducers to keep my front-end updated as requests were made to the back-end.  I created more components than I had originally planned, just to get my app to operate exactly how I wanted.  Sometimes I wish I would write a more technical blog but to me these things I've learned about overcoming challenges, pushing through unexpected obstacles, and having a vision to work towards are much more representative of what I have learned in my time at Flatiron School.</p>

<p>I guess I will end it with an epiphany I had.  Those big picture moments where your understanding levels up because you aren't just learning how to build a website and connect A to B, but when your understanding grows in a way that your overall understanding of what the code is actually doing helps me immensely in my approach and appreciation of the design philosophies behind something like React.  I didn't initially understand Reducers and what they were actually doing but I understand now that their entire job is to replicate virtually what's happening on the backend by keeping your Redux Store up-to-date without needing a page refresh, or even a full, new, JSON fetch of all of your data.  We're using the capabilities of all the power we have in our devices to put less strain on network activity by emulating as much as possible on the front-end, itself.  I appreciate it more now since reaching this epiphany and I've gained a lot of insight into how web apps operate and this in-turn will give me bigger and better ideas for what's possible.  I look forward to continuing my journey with React, and with programming, as I start my new career.  A career that will never lack for challenges and learning, and I can't think of anything more exciting than that.</p>
