<p>I've spent my whole life studying game design and game design theory.  It's been a personal study of mine as while I have my mainstays I try my best to always seek out new experiences so as to broaden my horizons.  Art in general can provide so many unique perspectives and experiences.  It's useful in design to take inspiration from as many sources as possible.  You really can enhance any school of thought or type of thinking by adding in perspectives from seemingly unrelated fields.</p>

<p>In mechanics and engineering one must still consider design in order for a tool or product to serve its intended purpose.  As such I feel that coding can benefit much when the usage or the "intended design" of the tool is considered.  I sometimes think I can spend too much time in the "pre-production" phase when it comes to coding.  I can't say that it hasn't been difficult at times however I always feel like obstacles and errors feel less of a problem once I've figured out the bigger picture.  There comes a lot of vision and trust but it helps me think about the things I'll need down the line and build my project with those elements in mind.  Even if tons of errors come up in the path of achieving my vision, every bug squashed brings me one step closer to realizing it.</p>

<p>In the end I think that considering the end user and what it is they need in order to have a logical experience that helps them stay efficient is key to designing any app.  Being a full-stack developer I understand better the amount of effort it takes to keep each piece of the puzzle efficient and effective in achieving its particular goal so that the other pieces can operate assuming those pieces are working how they should.  It really is a great feeling to now be able to design an app and its workflow from the backend to the frontend.  Each day I learn smaller things that add to my overview and that "bigger picture" makes even starting from scratch easier and easier, every time.</p>
